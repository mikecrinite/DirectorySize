This project is just a simple tool I am working on to determine
which subdirectories in a given directory take up the most space.

It will be expanded on in the future, but in the meantime, that
is the limit of its functionality.

It should work on any system (with Java 7+ installed): 
Mac OS X, Linux, or Windows
